Use this checklist to make sure your website conforms with card network standards and best practices for internet commerce.

This checklist contains a list of the common elements—such as product descriptions, clear policies, and proper security features—that each business using Paymennt should address on its website. Following those recommendations reduces the risks of customer confusin and disputed. It also helps you meet Paymennt's standards and the standards set by the credit card networks.

## Website Go-Live Checklist
### Description of what you are selling
Besides only listing the name of the product or service, you can help customers with their purchasing decision by providing detailed text descriptions of what you’re selling. For physical goods, include multiple pictures and information about material, colors, and other details. This is also an important measure to protect against potential disputes: setting the right expectations up front gives your customers a clear idea of what they get for their money.

If we review your website and find that it isn’t clear what you’re selling, we may contact you with recommendations for improving the description.

### Price and purchase currency
To support all shoppers, clearly display the currency associated with the prices on your site. Listing only the currency symbol may not be enough, so be as explicit as possible when showing prices.

### Customer service contact information
Make sure your customers can find multiple contact methods on your site, including direct communication channels, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and live chat (something besides contact forms). Low-friction communication is key to providing a good customer experience and heading off misunderstandings early on, helping to avoid disputes.

​​If we review your website and can’t find a clear way to contact you, we may ask that you add some contact options to the site.

### Fulfilment policies
Your customers should be able to determine how you fulfill and handle orders. Depending on your business nature and products or services offered, you should provide relevant policies that may include:

- **Refund policy**. Describe under what conditions customers can receive a refund.
- **Delivery policy**. Describe how and where goods are shipped, and on what timeline.
- **Return policy**. Describe under what conditions customers can return purchased goods.
- **Cancellation policy**. Describe under what conditions customers can cancel subscriptions or reservations.

Being clear and fair in these policies goes a long way toward building customer trust, and it can also provide you with protection against disputes. If we review your website and can’t find information on your fulfillment policies, we may request that you add some additional content about order fulfillment.

### Website privacy policy
Consumer data privacy is now a priority for legislation and governments around the world. Clearly explaining your website’s privacy policy helps you both comply with privacy laws and helps your customers understand how their data is protected, used, or disclosed.

### Your business address
If you have a physical address, listing it on your website adds credibility for your business.

### The logos of the cards you accept
You can reduce friction in the checkout process by displaying the brand logos of the credit cards that you accept, making it clear to customers that you accept their preferred card.

## Card network policies
These guidelines are based on the rules published by the card networks. As an online merchant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you’re compliant with these rules, including the [Visa Rules and Regulations](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/about-visa/visa-rules-public.pdf) and Regulations, and the [Mastercard Rules](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/business/overview/support/rules.html).
