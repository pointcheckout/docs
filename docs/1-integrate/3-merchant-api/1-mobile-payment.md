title: Integrate Payment into your Mobile App with PointCheckout
sidebar_label: Mobile Payment
---

Make getting paid faster and easier than ever! PointCheckout APIs provide an easy way to let your customers pay for their orders easily and securely.

:::danger SERVER API CALL
API calls made to the PointCheckout API endpoints should be made from your backend server. You should **NEVER** include your API key and secret in your mobile application. A malicious user can gain access to your account if those keys were exposed.
:::

## Integration flow
 
1. When a customer is ready to pay for their order/service on your mobile application, the mobile application sends a request to the backend server.
2. The backend server processes the order and makes the [Create mobile checkout](/api/#operation/create-mobile-checkout) API call to PointCheckout & obtains a checkout ID and a redirect URL.
3. Use the [Android SDK](/docs/integrate/sdks/android) and [iOS SDK](/docs/integrate/sdks/ios) provided by PointCheckout to complete the payment.
4. Alternatively, pass the redirect URL from PointCheckout API call to the mobile app and open it in a webview.
5. Once the webview Changes to one of the endpoints below, you should close the webview, and on your backend server, make  the [Get Checkout](/api/#operation/get-checkout) API call to retrieve the status.
6. Based on the status of payment retrieved from the [Get Checkout](/api/#operation/get-checkout) API call, you should update your order status on your backend system, and display confirmation to the customer.

That's it! You're ready to start testing.

## Payment confirmation endpoints

When the webview page URL changes to a confirmation endpoint, you should close the webview and check the payment status. 

Confirmation endpoints:

* `{pointcheckout-pay-base-url}`**/complete**
* `{pointcheckout-pay-base-url}`**/success-redirect**
* `{pointcheckout-pay-base-url}`**/payment-confirmation**

Possible values for `{pointcheckout-pay-base-url}`:

Live : **https://pay.pointcheckout.com**

Test : **https://pay.test.pointcheckout.com**


## Test the Integration

1. Go to your mobile app and initiate the payment process.
2. You should see the PointCheckout payment page.
3. Enter the following card details:
    * Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
    * Expiry date: `12/25`
    * CVV: `100`
    * Name: `TEST USER`
4. Accept the **Terms & Conditions** and click **Pay**. You will be redirected to the order confirmation page. If you entered a real email address in the billing details, you'll also receive a payment confirmation email.
5. Check the status of the payment on your backend administration panel.
