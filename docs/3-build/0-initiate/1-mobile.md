On this page we describe the steps required to initiate and verify a payment via the PointCheckout payment gateway for mobile based applications using the PointCheckout mobile SDKs.

## How it works
Three steps are required to accept payments via the PointCheckout payment gateway for mobile-based applications using the PointCheckout SDKs:
1. Create a new Mobile Checkout
2. Initiate the `PointCheckoutClient` using the `checkoutKey` received in the response
3. On callback, query the API for the payment status

The diagram below shows the overall flow to be used in order to accept payments using the PointCheckout
web integration

## Step 1: Create a new checkout
:::danger SERVER API CALL
API calls made to the PointCheckout API endpoints should be made from your server. You should NEVER include your API keys in your mobile application. A mallicious user can gain access to your account if those keys are exposed.
:::

When the customer is ready to pay, create a new mobile checkout by making a call from your server to <a href="/api/#operation/create_checkout_mobile" target="_blank">`POST /checkout/mobile`</a>. In your request, you must include the following required parameters:

**Parameter**|**Description**
--|--
`requestId` | A unique Identifier for this request, can be used later to query the status on the checkout
`orderId` | This can be the order ID. Must match any reference shown to the user during checkout / order history
`currency` | ISO 4217 Currency Code (3 letter currency code)
`amount` | A postive decimal number representing the amount customer should pay
`customer` | The details of the customer making teh payment
`billingAddress` | The customer billing address
`deliveryAddress` | The address where the service will be delivered
`items` | An array of the items associated with this order

Here's an example of how you would create a new checkout for **100.00 AED**:

```bash title="curl"
curl -L -X POST "https://api.test.pointcheckout.com/mer/v2.0/checkout/mobile" \
-H "X-POINTCHECKOUT-KEY: YOUR_X-POINTCHECKOUT-KEY" \
-H "X-POINTCHECKOUT-SECRET: YOUR_X-POINTCHECKOUT-SECRET" \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "requestID": "EXAMPLE-123.1",
  "orderID": "EXAMPLE-123",
  "currency": "AED",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "customer": {...},
  "billingAddress": {...},
  "deliveryAddress": {...},
  "items": [...]
}'
```

:::tip Failed or cancelled orders
If a payment fails or customer cancels the the payment, you cannot reuse the same `requestId`. You can however use the same `orderId` to create a new checkout.
:::

## Step 2: Initiate the PointCheckoutClient
The response from **Step 1** above will result in a new checkout being succesffully created for your merchant account. Once received, use the `checkoutKey` to initiate the client

```jsx title="200 Response"
{
  "success": true,
  "elapsed": 12,
  "result": {
    "id": "1653241101733169556",
    "requestId": "EXAMPLE-123.1",
    "orderId": "EXAMPLE-123",
    "currency": "AED",
    "amount": 100.00,
    "status": "PENDING",
    "checkoutKey": "90ed4298f15d46df994fd1cfbbec5aa24390e811295cf8b5",
    ...
  }
}
```

To learn more about the specific mechanism to use our SDKs, you can view the instructions for each of the SDK platforms below:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col col--3">
    <Card
      image="/img/docs/integrate/sdks/android-logo.svg"
      link="/docs/integrate/sdks/android"
      action="Android">
      Android
    </Card>
  </div>
  <div class="col col--3">
    <Card
      image="/img/docs/integrate/sdks/ios-logo.svg"
      link="/docs/integrate/sdks/ios"
      action="iOS">
      iOS
    </Card>
  </div>
</div>

## Step 3: Verifying payment status
Once the payment process has completed (regardless of status), the SDK will excute the callback function passed to the SDK during the client initialization in **Step 2**.

To verify the payment status, make an API call from your server to <a href="/api/#operation/get_checkout" target="_blank">`GET /checkout/{checkoutId}`</a>. The `checkoutId` is the ID received in the server response in **Step 1**

Here's an example of how you can query the status of checkout with id `1653241101733169556`:

```bash title="curl"
curl -L -X GET "https://api.test.pointcheckout.com/mer/v2.0/checkout/1653241101733169556" \
-H "X-POINTCHECKOUT-KEY: YOUR_X-POINTCHECKOUT-KEY" \
-H "X-POINTCHECKOUT-SECRET: YOUR_X-POINTCHECKOUT-SECRET" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

:::tip CONFIRMING CHECKOUT IS `PAID`
A paid checkout will have the status of `PAID`. If the checkout has a status other than paid, you should either display and error or take the user back to the checkout flow.
:::

### Checkout status values

Below is a list of available status codes that may be provided via the PointCheckout API to describe the status of a checkout:

STATUS | DETAILS
:-- | :--
**`PENDING`** | New Checkout. User has not completed the payment.
**`AUTHORIZED`** | The payment has been authorized. A subsequent `CAPTURE` or `CANCEL` API call is expected before expiry.
**`PAID`** | This status is effective when a customer has successfully completed the payment associated with this checkout.
**`FAILED`** | Payment failed due to payment failure. PointCheckout failed to recover such a checkout process.
**`CANCELLED`** | User cancelled the checkout process and returned to the merchant page.
**`EXPIRED`** | Checkout has expired without being processed
**`REFUNDED`** | Checkout has been fully refunded to customer
**`PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`** | Checkout have been partially refunded to customer

## Step 4: Test the Integration
Once your integration is ready, you can use the below test card details to verify your integration
* Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
* Expiry date: `12/25`
* CVV: `100`
* Name: `TEST USER`
